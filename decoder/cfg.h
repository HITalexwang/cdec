/* for target FSA intersection, we want to produce a simple (feature weighted) CFG using the target projection of a hg.  this is essentially isomorphic to the hypergraph, and we're copying part of the rule info (we'll maintain a pointer to the original hg edge for posterity/debugging; and perhaps avoid making a copy of the feature vector).  but we may also want to support CFG read from text files (w/ features), without needing to have a backing hypergraph.  so hg pointer may be null?  multiple types of CFG?  always copy the feature vector?  especially if we choose to binarize, we won't want to rely on 1:1 alignment w/ hg

   question: how much does making a copy (essentially) of hg simplify things?  is the space used worth it?  is the node in/out edges index really that much of a waste?  is the use of indices that annoying?

   the only thing that excites me right now about an explicit cfg is that access to the target rhs can be less painful, and binarization *on the target side* is easier to define

   using indices to refer to NTs saves space (32 bit index vs 64 bit pointer) and allows more efficient ancillary maps for e.g. chart info (if we used pointers to actual node structures, it would be tempting to add various void * or other slots for use by mapped-during-computation ephemera)
