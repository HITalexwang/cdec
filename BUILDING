To build cdec, you'll need:

 * SRILM (register and download from http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/)
 * Google c++ testing framework (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/)
 * boost headers & boost program_options (you may need to install a package
    like boost-devel)


Instructions for building
-----------------------------------

 1) Download and build SRILM

 2) Download, build, and install Google Test

 3) Use automake / autoconf to generate the configure script.
    I'm not an expert at using these tools, so I'm not quite sure how to do
    this, I just flail around until it works.  Since I have my own m4 scripts
    you'll need to make sure to do:

        aclocal -I m4/

    I usually have to do some permutation of the following commands:

        aclocal -I m4/
        autoconf
        automake -a
        autoreconf

 4) Configure and build.  Your command will look something like this.

        ./configure --with-sirlm=/home/me/software/srilm-1.5.9 --with-gtest=/home/me/software/gtest
        make

    If you get errors during configure about missing BOOST macros, then step 3
    failed, and you need to keep working at it.  If you get errors during the
    build, it's probably a problem with step 3 or possibly with some compiler
    version idiosyncracies (generally, I assume you have a relatively new
    of g++).

 5) Test

        ./tests/run-system-tests.pl

    Everything should pass.


 6) Enjoy!
