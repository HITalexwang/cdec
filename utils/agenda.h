/*
  a priority queue where you expect to queue the same item at different
  priorities several times before finally popping it.  higher priority = better.
  so in best first you'd be using negative cost or e^-cost (probabilities, in
  other words).

  this means you have a way to look up a key and see its location in the queue,
  so its priority can be adjusted (or, simpler implementation: so when you pop,
  you see if you've already popped before at a lower cost, and skip the
  subsequent pops).

  it's assumed that you'll never queue an item @ a better priority after it has
  already been popped.  that is, the agenda will track already completed items.
  maybe in the future i will let you recompute a cheaper way to reach things
  after first-pop also, it's assumed that we're always improving prios of
  existing items, never making them worse (even though technically this is
  possible and sensible if it hasn't been popped yet).

  simple binary max heap for now.  there are better practical options w/
  superior cache locaility.  movements in the heap need to update a record for
  that key of where the key went.  i do this by creating canonical key pointers
  out of boost object pools (if the key were lightweight e.g. an int, then it
  would make sense to use the hash lookup too

  since i'm doing key hashing to start with, i also allow you to attach some
  arbitrary data (value) payload beyond key+priority.

  hash map from key to done (has been popped) -> set where doneness is marked in key item?

  a slightly different way to make an adjustable heap would be to use
  tree-structured parent/children links intrusively (or mapped by key) in the
  key, rather than indices in a compact binary-tree heap
