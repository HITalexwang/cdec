BUG: tune is bad - urdu conf=baseline tuning (16 dev bleu score???)

conf=baseline force=1 ./tune.sh

  decode is good.

  UPDATE: maybe tuning is fine; chris never gave me a dev-corpus-filtered grammar and so a bleu of 16 may be what we always got; i just never checked.  this means i need to redo tuned-first-pass experiments

valgrind is ok

  dist-vest?

  (changes made to scoring? plusequals? shared_ptr?  small_vector?)

  scorer_test is good


  line_optimer fast_score scorer
